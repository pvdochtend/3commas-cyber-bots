## Why did you build these bot helpers?

I rather don't want to pay for Monthly services if this is not needed, I rather invest it in crypto. (or Coffee to program) And I also want to learn how things work in the Crypto world.

## GalaxyScore bot helper named `galaxyscore.py`
Type = trading pair

### What does it do?

It will monitor LunarCrush's GalaxyScores and use the Top X to create pairs for your 3Comma's composite DCA bots to use.

### How does it work?

The GalaxyScore Top 10 coins from LunarCrush are downloaded, the base pair of each of the specified 3Comma's bots is determined, from this new pairs are constructed, these are checked against your Blacklist on 3Comma's and the market data on 3Comma's (reflecting Binance or FTX data depending on your exchange) to see if the pairs are valid.

If this is the case -and the current pairs are different than the current ones- the bot(s) are updated. When the number of pairs to update the bot with is lower then the number of active deals configured in the bot, 3C will raise an error. Use the `originalmaxdeals` as the desired number of active deals, and set `allowmaxdealchange` to `True` to indicate this script may lower the max number of active deals to the number of pairs the bot is being updated with. This will prevent 3C raising an error, and when more pairs are available the max number of active deals will be increased to `originalmaxdeals`.

After this the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

When the SHAREDIR option is used, this script will try to read a `.pairexclude` file for each configured bot. If a pair is listed in the file it will be excluded from the pairs before updating the bot. This can be usefull when also using the DealCluster script in parallel with this script.

3Commas does not allow a bot without trading pairs, however, based on the configuration and market an empty list can be the result. Enable `allowmaxdealchange` and `allowbotstopstart` to decrease the number of active deals, or stop the bot when no pairs are available. When the bot is stopped, and there are pairs available again, it will be started.

NOTE: make sure you specify a 'Trading 24h minimal volume' value in your bot(s), otherwise you can end up with 'shitcoins'. Check the LunarCrush website or galaxyscore.log file after running in debug mode for a while to see which coins and values are retrieved, and decide how much risk you want to take.

### Configuration

The configuration file for `galaxyscore` has the following settings:

-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 3600)
-   **debug** - set to true to enable debug logging to file. (default is False)
-   **logrotate** - number of days to keep logs. (default = 7)
-   **3c-apikey** - your 3Commas API key value.
-   **3c-apisecret** - your 3Commas API key secret value.
-   **lc-apikey** - your LunarCrush API key value.
-   **notifications** - set to true to enable notifications. (default = False)
-   **notify-urls** - one or a list of apprise notify urls, each in " " seperated with commas. See [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for more information.

-   *[bot_]*
-   **maxaltrankscore** - set this lower for galaxyscore bot helper so altrank score of coin gets evaluated too. (default is 1500)
-   **mingalaxyscore** - minimum galaxyscore of the coin. (default is 0.0)
-   **numberofpairs** - number of pairs to update your bot(s) with. Set to 0 if you want to have exactly the `maximum active deals` for each bot as pair amount. (default is 10)
-   **originalmaxdeals** - the max number of active deals you want to have in your bot.
-   **allowmaxdealchange** - indicates if the max number of active deals in the bot may be changed to a lower value.
-   **allowbotstopstart** - indicates if the bot may be stopped when there are zero trading pairs, and may be started when there are trading pairs again.
-   **comment** - free field you can use, for example for the name or description of the bot

Example: (keys are bogus)
```

### Configuration

The configuration file for `altrank` has the following settings:

-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 3600)

## CoinMarketCap bot helper named `coinmarketcap.py`
Type = trading pair

### What does it do?

It will monitor CoinMarketCap and use the Top X to create pairs for your 3Comma's composite DCA bots to use.

### How does it work?

The CoinMarketCap API is used to request a list, sorted on marketcap and only containing `start-number - end-number` coins (Top X coins). The base pair of each of the specified 3Comma's bots is determined, from this new pairs are constructed, these are checked against your Blacklist on 3Comma's and the market data on 3Comma's (reflecting Binance or FTX data depending on your exchange) to see if the pairs are valid.

If this is the case -and the current pairs are different than the current ones- the bot(s) are updated.

After this the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

This script can be used for multiple bots with different Top X coins by creating multiple `cmc_` sections in the configuration file. For each section CMC data is fetched and processed as described above. Make sure each section starts with `cmc_` between the square brackets, what follows does not matter and can be used to give a descriptive name for yourself.

When the SHAREDIR option is used, this script will try to read a `.pairexclude` file for each configured bot. If a pair is listed in the file it will be excluded from the pairs before updating the bot. This can be usefull when also using the DealCluster script in parallel with this script.

NOTE: the 'Trading 24h minimal volume' value in your bot(s) can be used to prevent deals with low volume. Random pairs can be excluded using the blacklist. The first top coins (like BTC and ETH) can also be excluded by increasing the start-number.

-   *[settings]*
-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 86400)
-   **debug** - set to true to enable debug logging to file. (default is False)
-   **logrotate** - number of days to keep logs. (default = 7)
-   **3c-apikey** - your 3Commas API key value.
-   **3c-apisecret** - your 3Commas API key secret value.
-   **cmc-apikey** - your CoinMarketCap API key value.
-   **notifications** - set to true to enable notifications. (default = False)
-   **notify-urls** - one or a list of apprise notify urls, each in " " seperated with commas. See [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for more information.

-   *[cmc_]*
-   **botids** - a list of bot id's to manage separated with commas
-   **start-number** - start number for the pairs to request (exclude first x). (default is 1)
-   **end-number** - end number for the pairs to request. (default is 200)

## 3C-tools BotAssistExplorer bot helper named `botassistexplorer.py`
Type = trading pair

### What does it do?

It will fetch the specfied 3C-tools Bot-Assist Top X pairs for your 3Comma's composite DCA bots to use.

### How does it work?

The data is gathered from the 3c-tools.com website which is sorted on the type of list requested and the pairs between `start-number` and `end-number` are processed. These pairs are not reconstructed but used as they are, after being checked against your Blacklist on 3Comma's (or your optional local blacklist file) and the market data on 3Comma's (reflecting Binance, FTX  etc. depending on your exchange) to see if the pairs are valid.

If this is the case -and the current pairs are different than the current ones- the bot(s) are updated. When the number of pairs to update the bot with is lower then the number of active deals configured in the bot, 3C will raise an error. Use the `originalmaxdeals` as the desired number of active deals, and set `allowmaxdealchange` to `True` to indicate this script may lower the max number of active deals to the number of pairs the bot is being updated with. This will prevent 3C raising an error, and when more pairs are available the max number of active deals will be increased to `originalmaxdeals`.

After this the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

This script can be used for multiple bots with different Top X lists by creating multiple `botassist_` sections in the configuration file. For each section bot-assist data is fetched and processed as described above. Make sure each section starts with `botassist_` between the square brackets, what follows does not matter and can be used to give a descriptive name for yourself.

When the SHAREDIR option is used, this script will try to read a `.pairexclude` file for each configured bot. If a pair is listed in the file it will be excluded from the pairs before updating the bot. This can be usefull when also using the DealCluster script in parallel with this script.

3Commas does not allow a bot without trading pairs, however, based on the configuration and market an empty list can be the result. Enable `allowmaxdealchange` and `allowbotstopstart` to decrease the number of active deals, or stop the bot when no pairs are available.

## Futures trailing stoploss bot helper named `trailingstoploss.py`
Type = stop loss

### What does it do?

It will change the trailing stoploss of a futures bot when the profit % >= as the activation-percentage setting.

### How does it work?

Every interval the bots specfied in the config are read, their active deals are checked for profit %.
If the value is above or equal to activation-percentage the SL is recalculated, like so:  

`new_stoploss = stoploss + (last_profit_percentage - actual_profit_percentage)`
			
Deals are marked as processed and last SL value of the bot is stored to be used for next iterations.

Then the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

NOTES by the creator:  

As 3C doesnt appear to allow any TSL for bots, only TTP. TSL only appears to work on smart trade, so I want the ability to have TSL for my futures bots which dont have any SO.

Not sure how this script would work with bots that make use of many SO's - so please bear this in mind.
I would suggest a quicker interval for checking, so the config sets this to 90 seconds by default.

You must have a SL set on the deals within the bot you want this script to manage.

The script will keep track of the last profit % the SL was updated, and will compare the lastest profit %, and move the TSL up when required. The script does not move the SL down, as this wouldn't make sense.
I have also catered for the fact that the user might update the SL manually after activation on the 3C website - in this case the TSL is restarted for the deal that was manually altered.

About the initial-stoploss-percentage:  

This will allow the below scenario:  
Original deal stoploss is 5%, the activation % is triggered at 2% profit.  
The script can move the stoploss straight to -0.01% to guarantee profit (example initial-stoploss-percentage), the trailingstoploss will then track the price up to ensure more guaranteed profit.  

Value \[\] means the script will continue working as the old revision and a traditional TSL

I would use this with caution. I am only using this to reduce my liquidation risk on my futures bots - but could be used with spot bots if you know what you're doing.

### Configuration

This is the layout of the config file used by the `trailingstoploss.py` bot helper:

-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 3600)
-   **debug** - set to true to enable debug logging to file. (default is False)
-   **logrotate** - number of days to keep logs. (default = 7)
-   **botids** - a list of bot id's to manage separated with commas
-   **activation-percentage** - % of profit at which script becomes active for a bot
-   **initial-stoploss-percentage** - % of profit to amend at first activation (\[\] = disable)
-   **3c-apikey** - your 3Commas API key value.
-   **3c-apisecret** - your 3Commas API key secret value.
-   **notifications** - set to true to enable notifications. (default = False)
-   **notify-urls** - one or a list of apprise notify urls, each in " " seperated with commas. See [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for more information.

## DCA Trailing stoploss and profit bot helper named `trailingstoploss_tp.py`
Type = stop loss

### What does it do?

It will change the trailing stoploss (and optionally the profit %) of a DCA deal when the profit % is above the activation-percentage setting. Works for both long and short deals.

### How does it work?

The bot does run on two intervals; a check interval to check the active deals and one for monitoring deals with a stoploss set. For the trailing stoploss a shorter interval is required, in order to keep the deal up to date.

Both intervals perform the same steps. First the bots are read, their active deals are checked for profit %.
If the value is above or equal to activation-percentage, the initial SL is calculated, like so:  

`new_stoploss = initial-stoploss + (actual_profit_percentage - activation_percentage)`

This script also supports a configurable timeout for the stoploss, which will be activated (and updated) when the stoploss is activated. For example, with a timeout of 60 seconds, 3Commas will sell the deal (market order) when after 60 seconds the current price is still below the set stoploss price.

The take profit can also be increased using the `tp-increment-factor` and the calculation is like this:

`new_takeprofit = takeprofit + ((actual_percentage - activation_percentage) * tp-increment-factor)`

Configuring the `tp-increment-factor` to 0.0 will disable the increment and leave the TP untouched to what is configured in the bot.

Do note that extra profit is directly included if the `increment-factor` is greater than 0.0! So, for example, when the `activation-percentage` is set to 3.0% and the `actual profit` is 3.2%, this 0.2% is immediately added to the `initial-stoploss`.

The last profit percentage of the deal is stored to be used for next iterations, so the bot only evaluates deals for which the % profit has increased to avoid unnecessary processing. In the calcutions shown above the `current` and `last` profit percentage will then be used.

While processing the deals, the script will keep track of:
- The number of deals with SL activated, which is required to determine which time interval (check or monitor) to use.
- The active deals. Deals which where monitored before and are not active anymore (closed) are removed from the database in order to prevent an every growing database.

Then the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

This script can be used for multiple bots with different TSL and TP settings by creating multiple tsl_tp_ sections in the configuration file. Each section is processed as described above. Make sure each section starts with tsl_tp_ between the square brackets, what follows does not matter and can be used to give a descriptive name for yourself.

### Advanced configuration
This script supports some advanced configuration which should be understood! The basic purpose is to provide a trailing stoploss and optionally increasing take profit. When a deal starts to make profit the price will go up and down and therefor some space should be available to do so. So, for example, at 2% the SL can be set around 0.5% so the 1.5% can be used to go up and down. When the profit increases, for example to 4%, you may want to set the SL to 3% to avoid missing some profit (otherwise the SL would still be around 2%, depending on the `sl-increment-factor`). And sometimes, you just want to prevent a deal going down and rather have a fixed SL at a certain percentage.

The great thing is; this is all possible with this script. The `config` of each section can contain one or more configurations which will be used. Make sure the configuration are in order, increasing in `activation-percentage`! As example:
- The first configuration could have a lower `activation-percentage` of 2.0%, an `initial-stoploss-percentage` of 0.5% and the `increment-factors` are set to 0.0 (disabled).
- The second configuration could have a `activation-percentage` of 3.0%, an `initial-stoploss-percentage` of 2.0% and the `increment-factors` are greater than 0.0 (enabled).
This will result in a fixed SL of 0.5% when the profit reaches 2.0%. Even when the price or market dumps, you don't end up with a red bag because of this SL. Between 2.0% and the 3.0%, the SL remains untouched. As soon as the profit reaches the 3.0%, the second configuration will be used and the SL is directly set to 2.0%; and from there the trailing starts. 

See the configuration below as an example on how to do this.

## Compound bot helper named `compound.py`
Type = compounder

### What does it do?

It will compound profits made by a bot to the BO and SO of the same bot. The compound profits can also be used to increase the number of deals.

### How does it work?

Every interval the bots specfied in the config are read, their deals are checked for profits.
If profit has been made, the value will be added to the BO and SO values of the bot.
Deals are marked as processed and original BO/SO ratio of the bot is stored to be used for next iterations.

When compoundmode 'deals' is chosen, the profit will be added to the BO and SO values as above. Until the profit exceeds the total used per deal (total of the origional BO and SO's), the max active deals is increased and the BO and SO values are reset to their origional values.

Then the bot helper will sleep for the set interval time, after which it will repeat these steps.

### Configuration

This is the layout of the config file used by the `compound.py` bot helper:

-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 3600)
-   **debug** - set to true to enable debug logging to file. (default is False)
-   **logrotate** - number of days to keep logs. (default = 7)
-   **botids** - a list of bot id's to manage separated with commas.
-   **default-profittocompound** - ratio of profit to compound (1.0 = 100%, 0.85 = 85% etc).
-   **3c-apikey** - your 3Commas API key value.
-   **3c-apisecret** - your 3Commas API key secret value.
-   **notifications** - set to true to enable notifications. (default = False)
-   **notify-urls** - one or a list of apprise notify urls, each in " " seperated with commas. See [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for more information.

-   *[bot_id]*
-   **compoundmode** - how would you like compound? 'boso' to increase BO and SO values of the bot, 'deals' to increase max active deals (default is 'boso'), 'safetyorders' to increase the max safety orders.
-   **profittocompound** - ratio of profit to compound (1.0 = 100%, 0.85 = 85% etc).
-   **usermaxactivedeals** - the maximum number of active deals the compoundscript can increment to. (default is 5)
-   **usermaxsafetyorders** - the maximum number of safety orders the compoundscript can increment to. (default is 5)
-   **comment** - name of the bot, used for loggin.

## Watchlist bot helper named `watchlist_100eyes.py `
Type = start deal trigger

### What does it do?

It will monitor the Telegram chat channel of the https://www.100-eyes.com/ service (this is a paid service where you can select your own triggers to trigger on)
and sent a 'start new deal' trigger to the linked bot for that pair.

### How does it work?

Parse incoming Telegram messages, check the format of message for BTC_xxx or USDT_xxx pairs.  
3Commas blacklist and market are checked for the exchange the bot is connected to.  
The bot(s) need to have "Manually/API (Bot won't open new trades automatically)" as tirgger.  
It will only react on trigger messages as defined under `[triggers]` in your ini file, it wil ignore any others.

NOTE: You need to relay the 100eyes telegram channel to a non-secure one for the script to be able to subscribe to it.
You can use a (paid) service like telefeed, still need to see if open-source software is able to do this.

## Take profit bot helper named `tpincrement.py`
Type = takeprofit adjuster

### What does it do?

It will check active deals for the bot(s) specified and see how many SO are used, depending on number it will add a defined % per safety order to the TP value.

Some notes:

Example setting 'increment-step-scale = \[0.1, 0.05, 0.03\]' works like this:

Safety order 1 increment is 0.1%  
Safety order 2 increment is 0.05%  
Safety order 3 increment is 0.03%  

Safety orders > 3 are ignored and not adjusted (you can increase the number of steps in the config to cater more safety orders e.g. \[0.1, 0.05, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03\] will cater for 5 SO)

Upon each update inteval, the safety orders are compared from the last 'run', so no SO are missed, the difference is then calculated.
For example, using the above example config:

Update interval 1 = SO's complete is 0, so the increase is 0%  
Update interval 2 = SO's complete is 2, so the increase is 0.15%  
Update interval 3 = SO's complete is 3, so the increase is 0.03%  

Existing deals will be updated on the first initiation of the database - so please take this into account - this is by design.
Not yet tested over an extensive period.

## Deal cluster bot helper named `dealcluster.py`
Type = deal manager

### What does it do?
Tired of having multiple deals of the same pair open for a number of bots? This helper will help you out by adjusting the configured pairs in a bot inside a cluster.

### How does it work?
First, you will need to create a cluster of bots by configuring the `botids`. This script will start to monitor the active deals of these bots and register them in a local database.

The deals inside one cluster will be grouped in order to determine how many deals for a given pair are active. If this number exceeds the `max-same-deal`, the pair will be disabled for all the bots inside the cluster. Disabled means the pair configuration of the bots is updated and the specific pair is removed from them.

Once a deal is gone and the number of deals for this pair is below `max-same-deals`, the pair is enabled and the bots inside the cluster are updated again.

Notice you can create more than one cluster as long as each section starts with 'cluster_'. The example configuration below contains a single 'default' cluster.

When the SHAREDIR option is used, this script will create a `.pairexclude` file for each bot within a configured cluster. This file contains the pairs which have been disabled and can be used by other scripts to prevent enabling these pairs and triggering new deals, making this script ineffective.

Note: sometimes 3C deals can be opened within seconds and there is nothing this script can do to prevent it. Shorter intervals will decrease this possibility, but also beware 3C has a rate limit so do not go that low (the author used a minimum of 120 seconds).


Author of this script is [amargedon](https://github.com/amargedon).

### Configuration

The configuration file for `dealcluster` contains the following settings:

-   **timezone** - timezone. (default is 'Europe/Amsterdam')
-   **timeinterval** - update timeinterval in Seconds. (default is 3600)
-   **debug** - set to true to enable debug logging to file. (default is False)
-   **logrotate** - number of days to keep logs. (default = 7
-   **3c-apikey** - your 3Commas API key value.
-   **3c-apisecret** - your 3Commas API key secret value.
-   **notifications** - set to true to enable notifications. (default = False)
-   **notify-urls** - one or a list of apprise notify urls, each in " " seperated with commas. See [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) for more information.
-   *cluster_default*
-   **botids** - a list of bot id's to manage separated with commas.
-   **max-same-deals** - number of deals for the same pair allowed. (default = 1)

$ git clone https://github.com/cyberjunky/3commas-cyber-bots.git
$ cd 3commas-cyber-bots
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration of the bot helpers

For a new install just start the bot helper you want to use like below for altrank, a config file with the name of bot is created (ending in .ini)

```
$ python3 ./altrank.py
```

Then you can edit the file and start the bot helper again to use it.

Look at the helper sections above for each layout and description of the settings.


### 3Commas API key permissions needed
The 3Commas API need to have 'BotsRead, BotsWrite and AccountsRead' permissions, don't give it more than that to be safe.  
BotsRead: Required to get a list of all bots.  
BotsWrite: Required to update bot pairs.  
AccountsRead: Required to get connected exchanges to ensure that pairs are valid.  

### Telegram ID, Hash and Secrets explained
There are two sets of Telegram related settings.

#### Watchlist
One is used by `watchlist.py` to connect to the telegram API.

To get the Telegram App ID and hash you have to create an application ,

These are the steps as outlined in below link:

-   Login to your Telegram account [here](https://my.telegram.org/) with the phone number of the developer account to use.
-   Visit the [API development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
-   A Create new application window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any URL, and only the first two fields (App title and Short name) can currently be changed later.
-   Click on Create application at the end. Remember that your API hash is secret and Telegram won’t let you revoke it. Don’t post it anywhere!

Fill these in here inside watchlist.ini:
```
tgram-api-id = 1234566
tgram-api-hash = o6la4h1158ylt4mzhnpio6la
```

#### Notifications
The other set of values are used by to sent notifications to Telegram channel of your choice.
I use Apprise for this, all possible platform to send notifications to are described here [Apprise website](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)

The Telegram part is described [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/Notify_telegram#account-setup)

-   First you need to create a bot to get a bot_token
-   Open telegram and search for 'BotFather' start a conversation
-   Type: /newbot
-   Answer the questions it asks after doing this (which get the name of it, etc).
-   When you've completed step 2, you will be provided a bot_token that looks something like this: 123456789:alphanumeric_characters.
-   Type /start now in the same dialog box to enable and instantiate your brand new bot.

Fill in the notify-url like this:
```
notify-urls = [ "tgram://2097657222:AAFSebMCJF6rQ6l46n21280K8y59Mg6w13112w/"]

```
Now you also need a chat_id, don't worry Apprise can get this for you.
-   First sent a random message to your bot via the Telegram app.
-   Then start one of the bot helpers with above like notify-url setting.
and look at the logs, it should contain something like:
```
2021-11-11 19:39:02,930 - apprise - INFO - Detected Telegram user R (userid=936303417)
2021-11-11 19:39:02,930 - apprise - INFO - Update your Telegram Apprise URL to read: tgram://2...w/%40936302121/?image=False&detect=yes&format=text&overflow=upstream&rto=4.0&cto=4.0&verify=yes
```
-   Now copy and paste the whole part behind and including the % and paste it behind the notify-url you had configured, to avoid syntax errors you need to put an extra % in between so ...w/%%409... etc...

If you didn't send a message to your bot first this is what the logs show:
```
2021-11-11 19:35:14,682 - apprise - WARNING - Failed to detect a Telegram user; try sending your bot a message first.
2021-11-11 19:35:14,682 - apprise - WARNING - There were not Telegram chat_ids to notify.
```

### Running the bot helpers

#### Run Manually
`$ python3 ./galaxyscore.py`
and/or
`$ python3 ./altrank.py`
and/or
`$ python3 ./watchlist.py`
and/or
`$ python3 ./compound.py`

They also have some command-line options:

```
./galaxyscore.py -h
usage: galaxyscore.py [-h] [-d DATADIR] [-s SHAREDIR] [-b BLACKLIST]

Cyberjunky's 3Commas bot helper.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DATADIR, --datadir DATADIR
                        directory to use for config and logs files
  -s SHAREDIR, --sharedir SHAREDIR
                        directory to use for shared files between scripts
  -b BLACKLIST, --blacklist BLACKLIST
                        local blacklist to use instead of 3Commas's
```

The blacklist file layout is one pair per line.

### Example output for `altrank`

#### Start Automatically

Example service files `3commas-galaxyscore-bot.service`, `3commas-altrank-bot.service` (and `3commas-galaxyscore-env-bot.service`, `3commas-altrank-env-bot.service` if you use the .env enviroment described above) are provided,. They can all be found in the `scripts` directory, you need to edit the paths and your user inside them to reflect your install. And install the service you need as describe below.

```
$ sudo cp scripts/3commas-galaxyscore-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo systemctl start 3commas-galaxyscore-bot.service
$ sudo cp scripts/3commas-altrank-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo systemctl start 3commas-altrank-bot.service
```

### Need for multiple settings

If you want a set of bots having 20 pairs of AltRank/GalaxyScore and another set use 10, or want to trigger on multiple Telegram channels, you can simply copy the script and use a descriptive name, it will create and use it's own settings file, and logfile... as long as the original name is in the file name.
```
e.g.
$ cp altrank.py altrank10.py
$ ./altrank10.py 
2021-11-20 13:22:37 - altrank10.py - 3Commas bot helper altrank10!
2021-11-20 13:22:37 - altrank10.py - Started at Saturday 13:22:37 20-11-2021.
2021-11-20 13:22:37 - altrank10.py - Created example config file 'altrank10.ini', edit it and restart the program.

$ cp scripts/3commas-altrank-bot.service script/3commas-altrank10-bot.service
And change ExecStart entryr accordingly
```

### Options for hosting this

- Intel NUC, install Debian or Ubuntu without GUI.
  And follow installation steps above.
  
- Raspberry Pi, install the Raspberry Pi OS
  And follow installation steps above.

- Docker find all settings and [documentation here](docker/)



In the Cloud, if you are willing to store your config files with your API keys in the Cloud, these are some options:

- PythonAnywhere https://eu.pythonanywhere.com/ Create free account, click on 'Bash' button and do:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/cyberjunky/3commas-cyber-bots.git
$ cd 3commas-cyber-bots
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
  Then you can run any of the scripts.
  More instructions can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH2PhXYvrWs, if you want to run multiple bot helpers, create another Bash console by clicking on the 'Bash' button again, cd to the 3commas-cyber-bots folder and start the next.
  Please visit the wiki for more information [Wiki PythonAnywhere](https://github.com/cyberjunky/3commas-cyber-bots/wiki/PythonAnywhere)
  
- Google Cloud https://console.cloud.google.com Login with your gmail adress,goto 'Compute Engine', 'VM instances', create 
  You can create a small sized VM, you need to specify your CC details.
  More instructions can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL7fu2R4M8
  NOTE: From Europe there are no free VM's available as shown in the video, at least I could not find them.


### Run from Python Enviroment (optional)

You can use the install script called setup.sh to create this environment. Simply run it as ./setup.sh and you have the options:
```
usage:
	-i,--install    Install 3commas-cyber-bots from scratch
	-u,--update     Command git pull to update.
```
It creates a .env python enviroment to install the requirements in, and you can run the scripts from there without cluttering your machine.

Before running any of the scripts manually enter the virtual environment first
```
cd 3commas-cyber-bots
source .env/bin/activate
```

### TODO
- You tell me, I'm open for ideas and requests!

### FAQ

1) I get this when I try to start the bot:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./galaxyscore.py", line 7, in <module>
    from py3cw.request import Py3CW
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'py3cw'
```
Install the python requirements like so:
``` 
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Or run `setup.sh` script to install the Python environent with everything in it.

2) I get this error:
```
Fetching 3Commas pairs blacklist failed with error: {'error': True, 'msg': 'Other error occurred: api_key_invalid_or_expired Unauthorized. Invalid or expired api key. None.'}
```

Something is wrong with your 3Commas API keys, check the API key values in your `config.ini` file, you can paste them there without the " " 

3) I get this error:
```
  File "/usr/lib/python3.7/logging/init.py", line 1121, in _open
    return open(self.baseFilename, self.mode, encoding=self.encoding)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/pi/3commas-cyber-bots/logs/galaxyscore.log'
```

Create the 'logs' directory inside the bot folder.

4) I use telegram notifications and get the message:
```
Detected Telegram user R (userid=123456789)
2021-10-13 21:20:05,573 INFO - Update your Telegram Apprise URL to read: tgram://2...w/%123456789/?image=False&detect=yes&format=text&overflow=upstream&rto=4.0&cto=4.0&verify=yes
```
Apply the part behind and including the % to your tgram url in the config, but add another % infront of the % to suppress parse errors like this:
```
   raise InterpolationSyntaxError(
configparser.InterpolationSyntaxError: '%' must be followed by '%' or '(', found: '%123456789/?image=False&detect=yes&format=text&overflow=upstream&rto=4.0&cto=4.0&verify=yes" ]'
```

So it looks something like this: (strings are bogus)
```
notify-urls = [ "tgram://9995888120:BoJPor6opeHyxx5VVZPX-BoJPor6opeHyxx5VVZPX/%%123456789/?image=False&detect=yes&format=text&overflow=upstream&rto=4.0&cto=4.0&verify=yes" ]
```

5) I get this error running pip3 install step:
```
       #include <ffi.h>
                ^~~~~~~
      compilation terminated.
      error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 
```

Install libffi-dev with `sudo apt install libffi-dev` and try again.

6) I get error 'can't find Rust compiler':

Update pip3 like so:
```
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
And try again.

6) After running the watchlist.py script for a few days, the following errors sometimes shows up in the logs:
```
Error occurred while triggering start_new_deal bot 'Bot name' error: Other error occurred: Unknown error occurred#Exceptions::OpenDealPresentForThisPair None None.
```
This happens when your bot is in a paper trade account, `watchlist` will then ignore the exchange field in the trigger, so when two of the same pairs for different exchanges are triggered, you get the same pair twice, and 3Commas tells you that you already have a trade for this pair, this only happens in paper mode.

7) I get error 'TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()'
```
  File "./*.py", line 511, in callback
    if len(botids) == 0:
TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
```
Make sure usdt-botids and btc-botids are defined within [] in your ini files.

8) I get error `for account in data: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable`
```
  File "./*.py", line 250, in get_threecommas_account
    for account in data:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```
Newer versions of the scripts also need AccountRead permissions for the 3Commas API Keys.
Create new ones, with it and paste them in your ini file(s)

9) I get error `Error occurred updating bots: Other error occurred: signature_invalid Provided signature is invalid None.`  
The secret key specified for the 3Commas API is invalid, check for possible paste error.

10) I get error `2022-01-11 00:11:00 - altrank - Fetching LunarCrush data failed with error: 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: https://api.lunarcrush.com/v2?data=market&type=fast&sort=acr&limit=150&key=Your+LunarCrush+API+Key`
LunarCrush now expect a valid apikey again, create an account here [LunarCrush](https://lnr.app/s/o3p1V2) and login to https://legacy.lunarcrush.com/, then goto settings and API tab, create key and use this in altrank.ini and/or galaxyscore.ini.

### Debugging

Set debug to True in config.ini and check the appropriate log file under `logs/` for debug information
```
debug = True
```
